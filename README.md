# My portfolio

#### In this project I will create a portfolio to refer to in my resumÃ© for potential employers to get an overview of my coding skills and what I can contribute with as a person and programmer. I'm always eager to learn and develop by challenging myself!

I'll of course update this `README.md` file along the way so stay tuned for more info about this project. 

The portfolio will be using React and TypeScript ðŸš€
